:''Plane can also refer to [[airplane]].''

A '''plane''' is a perfectly flat surface extending in all directions. Try to imagine the ceiling of a room, only extended into all directions infinitely. A plane has two dimensions : [[length]] and [[width]]. All planes are flat surfaces. If a surface is not flat, it is called a ''[[curve]]d surface''. 

The tool ''[[plane_(tool)|plane]]'' can be used to create a flat, level surface like the mathematical plane: therefore the name.

In [[geometry]], a plane is made up of an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[line]]s (or [[point (geometry)|points]]). It has no [[depth]].

A ''plane figure'' is part of a plane. It is named by the capital letters (e.g. A, B, C, ...X, Y, Z) that are put at its [[corner]]s.

Mathematicians say two planes can be:
* [[Parallel (geometry)|Parallel]] = they never meet.
* Concurrent = they meet forming a line.
* Coincident = they are one and the same.

In [[mathematics]], a '''plane''' is a fundamental [[two-dimensional]] object. Intuitively, it looks like a flat infinite sheet of paper. There are several definitions of the plane. They are equivalent in the sense of [[Euclidean geometry]], but they can be extended in different ways to define objects in other areas of [[mathematics]]. The only 2 dimensional figure in our 3 dimensional world is a [[shadow]].

In some areas of mathematics, such as [[plane geometry]] or 2D [[computer graphics]], the whole space in which the work is carried out is a single plane. In such situations, the definite article is used: '''the plane'''. Many fundamental tasks in [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], and graphing are performed in the two dimensional space, or in other words, in the plane.

== Euclidean geometry ==
 	
A plane is a [[surface]] such that, given any three distinct [[point (mathematics)|points]] on the surface, the surface also contains all of the [[straight line]]s that pass through any two of them.
One can introduce a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] on a given plane in order to label every point on it with a unique ordered pair, which is composed of two numbers and is the coordinate of the point.

Within any Euclidean space, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following combinations:

* three points which are not lying on the same [[line]]
* a line and a point not on the line
* two different lines which intersect
* two different lines which are parallel
* a [[vector]] [[normal]] to the plane and a distance from the [[origin]].
