'''Jasmine rice''' ({{lang-th|[[wikt:ข้าวหอมมะลิ|ข้าวหอมมะลิ]]}}; {{RTGS|''Khao hom mali''}}; {{IPA-th|kʰâːw hɔ̌ːm malíʔ}}; {{lang-vi|Gạo thơm thượng hạng}}; {{lang-zh|泰国香米}};  {{pinyin|Tàiguó xiāngmǐ}}), also known as ''Thai hom mali'' or Thai fragrant rice, is a long-grain variety of [[rice]] that has a sweet aromatic fragrance, a subtle ''pandan''-like (''[[Pandanus amaryllifolius]]''-leaves) aroma caused by [[2-acetyl-1-pyrroline]].<ref name="wongpornchai">{{cite journal

}}</ref> Jasmine rice is grown primarily in [[Thailand]], and to a lesser degree in [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and southern [[Vietnam]]. The grains cling and are somewhat sticky when cooked, though less sticky than glutinous short-grain rice ([[Glutinous rice|''Oryza sativa'' var. ''glutinosa'']]), as it has less [[amylopectin]]. It is still about three times more sticky than American long-grain rice. It is moist and soft in texture when cooked, with a slightly sweet flavor. Like with other rices, freshness and maximal fragrance is retained within six months from the time it is harvested, after which the rice becomes dry and fragrance decreases when cooked.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-jasmine-rice.htm|title = What is Jasmine Rice?|date = |accessdate = |website = wiseGEEK|publisher = Conjecture Corporation|last = |first = }}</ref>

To harvest jasmine rice, the long stalks are cut and threshed. The rice can then be left in a [[Hulling|hulled]] form and sold as brown rice or shucked and sold as [[white rice]].

Thai jasmine rice and Cambodian rice share the same characteristics and grow mainly in neighbouring geographic areas on opposite sides of the northeastern Thai-Cambodian border. Cambodian jasmine rice (Khmer: ''angkaw kra'oup'') is cultivated in Cambodia and processed as white (milled and polished) and brown rice. Distinct Cambodian jasmine rice varieties  include these major three, namely ''phka rumduol, phka romeat, ''and ''phka rumdeng''. Recent DNA fingerprint analysis, carried out with 18 markers, shows that all three varieties possess 18 known fragrance alleles. Two varietals (''phka rumduol'' and ''phka rumdeng'') are distinct Cambodian with 17 markers in identical positions, with Thai jasmine rice and one fragrance marker each in a different position. The analysis of Cambodian ''phka romeat'' shows all 18 markers in identical positions with the trademarked Thai jasmine rice Thai ''hom mali''. <ref>http://www.cardi.org.kh/index.php?page=detail&ctype=article&id=212&lg=en{{full}}</ref>

Jasmine rice, though grown in Laos and [[southern Vietnam]], is not the predominant rice variety; [[glutinous rice]] is grown in Laos, and regular ''Oryza sativa ''predominates in Vietnam.

=== Glycemic index ===
Jasmine rice has [[glycemic index]] of 68-80.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Venn |first1=Bernard J |last2=Kataoka |first2=Minako |last3=Mann |first3=Jim |title=The use of different reference foods in determining the glycemic index of starchy and non-starchy test foods |journal=Nutrition Journal |volume=13 |issue= |pages=50 |year=2014 |pmid=24885045 |pmc=4047427 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-13-50 }}</ref> Foods with a glycemic index of 70 or lower are preferred in the diet due to their slower absorption which prevents large spikes in blood sugar after consumption. Not all rice has a high glycemic index, [[basmati rice]] for example, has a relatively low glycemic index of 59. However, it is uncommon for rice to be eaten alone. Rice is usually eaten with other foods that can reduce its glycemic index by 20-40 percent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sugiyama |first1=M |last2=Tang |first2=A C |last3=Wakaki |first3=Y |last4=Koyama |first4=W |title=Glycemic index of single and mixed meal foods among common Japanese foods with white rice as a reference food |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=57 |issue=6 |pages=743–52 |year=2003 |pmid=12792658 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601606 }}</ref>

== Culinary uses ==
Steamed jasmine rice is ideal for eating with stir-fries, with grilled, fried or braised food items, and in soups (when cooked slightly drier by adding a little less water during cooking). It often doesn't fare well when used for fried rice, as it's too soft and soggy when still warm. More experienced cooks will use rice that has been cooled down first for making fried rice.<ref>http://www.thekitchn.com/why-dayold-rice-makes-the-best-fried-rice-tips-from-the-kitchn-208326{{full}}</ref>
