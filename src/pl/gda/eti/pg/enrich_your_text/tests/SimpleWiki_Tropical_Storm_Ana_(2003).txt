'''Tropical Storm Ana''' was the only [[tropical cyclone]] on record in the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic Ocean]] in the month of April. Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Ana was two kinds of storms, a ''[[subtropical cyclone]]'', and a ''[[tropical cyclone]]''. It formed as a subtropical cyclone on April 20, while it was to the west of [[Bermuda]]. It moved towards the east-southeast and began to get better organized. On April 21, the subtropical cyclone became a tropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Ana then turned towards the east-northeast. It quickly lost strength because of [[wind shear]] and a close [[cold front]]. On April 24, Ana became an [[extratropical cyclone]]. 

The storm moved near Bermuda, while causing light rainfall. The remnants of the storm also dropped rain in the [[Azores]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Stormy sea waters caused by the storm capsized a boat near [[Florida]] coastline. The incident killed two people.

The storm was named Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20, while located about 250&nbsp;miles (400&nbsp;km) west of Bermuda.<ref name="tcr"/>

The subtropical storm moved to the east-southeastward and it continued to get stronger. It is estimated that Ana became a tropical storm by 0000&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on April 21. When it became a tropical cyclone, Ana reached its highest winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h). Shortly after, Ana came close to Bermuda.<ref name="tcr"/> Strong [[wind shear]] began to remove a lot of the thunderstorm activity from Ana.<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al012003.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> Ana continued to move  eastward,<ref name="disc3">{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Discussion Five|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/dis/al012003.discus.005.shtml?}}</ref> and early on April 22, the wind shear again removed the thunderstorms from the center of the storm. After turning towards the northeast, the core of Ana merged with a [[cold front]] on April 24. Because of t his, Tropical Storm Ana turned into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. The remnants of the cyclone sped towards the east-northeastward, before it died out on April 27.<ref name="tcr"/>

Before Ana was formed, the government of [[Bermuda]] declared a gale warning for the island.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=April 20 Special Tropical Disturbance Statement|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Disturbance/2003/Apr/2003042022.WONT41}}</ref> When Ana formed, a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] was also issued for Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|year=2003|title=Subtropical Storm Ana Public Advisory One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2003/pub/al012003.public.001.shtml?}}</ref> The storm moved close to Bermuda and dropped 2.63&nbsp;inches (67&nbsp;mm) of rainfall the [[Bermuda International Airport]].

Stormy seas from the storm reached the coast of [[Florida]] in the [[United States]].<ref name="tcr"/> A couple of factors, which included the stormy seas, caused a boat to capsize in [[Jupiter, Florida|Jupiter Inlet]]. Two people on the ship drowned, and the others were rescued.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Tropical Storm Ana Event Report|accessdate=2007-12-15|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~489312}}</ref> The remnants of Ana dropped 0.87&nbsp;inches (22&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in the city of [[Ponta Delgada]] in the [[Azores]].

Ana was the second [[subtropical cyclone]] on record in the [[Atlantic hurricane|Atlantic basin]] in the month of April. When the storm became a tropical cyclone, it was also the first Atlantic tropical storm in the month of April.<ref name="tcr"/> Because the damage from Ana was not bad, the name "Ana" was not retired by the [[World Meteorological Organization]]. The name Ana was used again in [[Tropical Storm Ana (2009)|2009]].
